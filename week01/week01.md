Experiment No.1

Title: Design of preprocessor for c.

Aim:

Theory:
* directives
	
1. Macro 	Syntax: #define
This macro defines constant value and can be any of the basic data types.

2. Header file inclusion 	Syntax: #include <file_name>
The source code of the file “file_name” is included in the main program at the specified place.

3. Conditional compilation 	Syntax: #ifdef, #endif, #if, #else, #ifndef
Set of commands are included or excluded in source program before compilation with respect to the condition. 

4. Other directives 	Syntax: #undef, #pragma
 #undef is used to undefine a defined macro variable. #Pragma is used to call a function before and after main function in a C program.
